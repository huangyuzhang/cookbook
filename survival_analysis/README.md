# Survival Analysis
Survival analysis corresponds to a set of statistical approaches used to investigate the time it takes for an event of interest to occur. Examples: patient death, customer churn, customer conversion...

The python packages used to implement survival analysis are mainly: [lifelines](https://lifelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [scikit-survival](https://github.com/sebp/scikit-survival).

This cookbook collects some notebooks based on the official documentation, examples in the Internet. The datasets used are stored in the `/data` folder.
